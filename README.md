# FXOSRenderingEngineTest
Java application to prototype hit testing and overlapping methods.  Clearly, this is not indicative of the speed, but does allow different approaches to be implemented quickly.

### Key

<span style="color:green">*Green*:</span>. Mouse Over

*Purple with White outlines:* Initial selection showing the overlapped rectangles.

*Purple:* Selected

New Windows C Version

This Windows application is used to prototype a faster hit testing and overlapping approach.  The new redraw is based on overlaps so it is much faster than that implemented in FXOS currently.

This code is generally portable to FXOS, so will be incorporated when time allows.
